# CSS--Bootsrap-responsivePortfolio

This repository documents the creation of a responsive portfolio.  
The portfolio includes index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html pages.
These pages were created using Bootstrap, hence the pages utilize Bootstrap's row and 12 column grid system.  Where possible, the pages utilize semantic HTML.
A navbar with working links displays at the top all three pages.
The layout is responsive, and it includes bootstrap media queries to display left and right borders besides a single column in xs and sm screens.
The information on the pages is personalized to fit my bio, name, images, and links to email and social media.
